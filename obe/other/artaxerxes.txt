====== Artaxerxes ======

===== Facts: =====

Artaxerxes was a king who reigned over the country of Persia from about 464 to 424 BC. 

  * During Artaxerxes' reign, the Israelites from Judah were in exile in Babylon, which was under the control of Persia at that time.
  * Artaxerxes allowed Ezra the priest and other Jewish leaders to leave Babylon and go back to Jerusalem to teach the Israelites the Law of God.
  * Later during this time, Artaxerxes also allowed his cupbearer Nehemiah to return to Jerusalem to lead the Jews in rebuilding the walls surrounding the city.
  * Note that this is not the same king as Xerxes.
